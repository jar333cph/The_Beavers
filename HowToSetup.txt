The Beavers — Spec-Clean, No-Server, 10-Level Version
====================================================

How to run:
1. Open config.js and paste your Gemini API key into GEMINI_API_KEY.
2. Save the file.
3. Double-click index.html to open the game in your browser.

What this version does:
- No local fetch() of JSON files (levels are in js/levels.js), so no CORS issues.
- No modules or bundling; everything is classic <script> tags.
- Screens:
  * Home (set codename, start new game, continue, go to levels/leaderboard)
  * Levels (select level, with Admin allowed to skip)
  * Game (chat with beaver, uses Gemini)
  * Leaderboard (shows scores from localStorage)
- All 10 levels are beaver-themed, one-word secret passwords.
